Week 3 Python Homework
PyBank and PyPoll activities

# PyBank
Started by establishing which variables I would need to track/store info. The average monthly change was the sticky part - I tried a few different variations on my loop before I got a usable result.

# PyPoll
My first attempt was very straightforward and used counters for each candidate to find totals, then calculated the percentages. But I knew there was a better way and wanted to script it in a way that would find the candiates itself and then do the work. So I saved it as firstattempt.py and then started fresh in the second_loops.py file.

Once I had things generally working I made a third copy (main.py) for submission and that's where I got all my print statements in place and put in the lines to write to a txt file.

# Helpful tools
pythoncheatsheet.org was very helpful with both - that's where I found some of the key bits that we didn't cover in class.
